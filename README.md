  ## Description
  The README Generator is an application that creates a high-quality README file, based on the inputs of the user into the command terminal. It was inspired by a lesson to apply the Inquirer npm package.

  ## Installation
  In order to install, the user must have a copy of the code and type 'index.js' into the command terminal (after installing the Inquirer npm package)

  ## Usage
  This application can be used anytime a user needs to mockup a high-quality README file, without having to constantly rewrite the formatting, etc.

  ## Contributing
  No additional contributions are accepted at this time.

  ## Tests
  This application has gone through hours of testing to ensure there are no hiccups...
